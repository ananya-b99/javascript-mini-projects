# javascript-mini-projects
This repository contains small JavaScript projects that I built during the process of learning JavaScript fundamentals, basic logic building, DOM manipulation, event handling, and interactive UI behaviour.

## Projects

### 1. Counter
- A simple counter with increment, decrement, and reset functionality.

- Helped reinforce basic logic and variable updates.
